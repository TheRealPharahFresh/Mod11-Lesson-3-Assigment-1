Description: In this code, a React component fetches and displays details of a Marvel character using the Marvel API. The `useParams` hook retrieves the `characterId` from the URL, and `useEffect` fetches character data when the ID changes. Axios is used to make the API request, and the response is stored in state. If there's an error, a message is shown; otherwise, the character's name, image, and description are displayed.
